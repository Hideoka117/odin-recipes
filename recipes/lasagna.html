        <li>Onion and Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato Products</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>

        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Cheeses</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Preheat oven</strong> to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, <strong> cook the meat </strong>, breaking it up with a spatula, until browned and cooked through. Drain the excess fat and transfer the meat to a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, cook the onion and garlic over medium heat until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the tomato, sugar, spices and seasonings and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the cheeses and egg <strong>until well combined.</strong></li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, <em>spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce </em> over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them. Spoon half of the cheese mixture over the noodles and spread evenly. Sprinkle half of the meat over the cheese. Repeat with another layer of sauce, noodles, cheese and meat. Top with the remaining sauce and sprinkle some more cheese if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes</strong> or until bubbly and golden. Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
        <li><b><em>Enjoy your delicious lasagna!</em></b></li>
