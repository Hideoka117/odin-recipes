    <p>
        Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or smashed with a burger press into a thin patty as soon as they hit the grill. This creates extra browning and flavor on the outside while maintaining the patty’s juiciness. <br>
        We love burgers, from classic Juicy Burgers to Cheeseburger Sliders. Making your own patty from ground beef tastes so much better than flash-frozen or fast-food patties. These go down easier and you feel better after eating a fresh homemade burger because you control the quality of ingredients.<br>
        If you are a fan of Smash Burgers this homemade version is a must-try!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Sauce</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Buns</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
    <ol> 
        <li><strong>Prepare Patties</strong> – Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Sauce</strong> – Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep Toppings</strong> – fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast buns</strong> – lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook patties</strong> – increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</li>
        <li><strong>Add cheese</strong> – place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</li>
        <li>Engoy your delicious burger!</li>
